Estimate availability of this configuration
Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- 45 minutes (As response time of support 15 minutes plus(+) backup retention time period is 30 minutes.)
Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- 1 hour (On-call support staff start diagnosing issue, so approx. 30 minutes for that plus(+) backup retention and promotion of replica will cost more 30 minutes.)
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- 10 minutes (because failovers are in different availability zones.)
Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- 24 hours (because usually takes place every 24 hour.)
